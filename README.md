# WWGAN
A simple implementation of WWGAN and the Wasserstein image space gradient penalty.

Forked from [Marvin Cao's wgan-gp](https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp)

_____
The Wasserstein of Wasserstein loss for generative models, assumes an optimal transport metric as a distance between samples. 
Details can be found from our paper [*Wasserstein of Wasserstein Loss for Learning Generative Models*](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/dukler19a/dukler19a.pdf)
